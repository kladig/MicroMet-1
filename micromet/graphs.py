def energy_sankey(df, date_text="2024-06-19 12:00"):
    """
    Create a Sankey diagram representing the energy balance for a specific date and time.

    This function generates a Sankey diagram to visualize the flow of energy in a system,
    typically used in meteorological or environmental studies. It calculates various
    energy balance components and creates a diagram showing their relationships.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    df : pandas.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing time series data with columns for different energy
        components (SW_IN, LW_IN, SW_OUT, LW_OUT, NETRAD, G, LE, H).
    date_text : str, optional
        A string representing the date and time for which to create the diagram.
        Default is "2024-06-19 12:00".

    Returns:
    --------
    plotly.graph_objs._figure.Figure
        A Plotly Figure object containing the Sankey diagram.

    Notes:
    ------
    - The function assumes that the DataFrame index is a DatetimeIndex.
    - Energy balance components are extracted from the DataFrame for the specified date.
    - The energy balance ratio (EBR) is calculated as (H + LE) / (NETRAD - G).
    - The residual term is calculated as NETRAD - (G + H + LE).
    - The Sankey diagram visualizes the flow of energy between different components.

    Energy Balance Components:
    --------------------------
    - SW_IN: Incoming Shortwave Radiation
    - LW_IN: Incoming Longwave Radiation
    - SW_OUT: Outgoing Shortwave Radiation
    - LW_OUT: Outgoing Longwave Radiation
    - NETRAD: Net Radiation
    - G: Ground Heat Flux
    - LE: Latent Heat
    - H: Sensible Heat

    Example:
    --------
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import plotly.graph_objs
    >>> # Assume 'df' is a properly formatted DataFrame with energy balance data
    >>> fig = energy_sankey(df, "2024-06-19 12:00")
    >>> fig.show()

    Dependencies:
    -------------
    - pandas
    - plotly.graph_objs
